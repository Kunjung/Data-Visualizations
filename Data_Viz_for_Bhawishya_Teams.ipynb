The climate is more than suitable for high grade coffee production but the fact that the locals are more into traditional farming(farming of rice, corn, millet, beans etc) not much attention is given towards coffee production. This project is based on making the coffee production plant fully automated so that more coffee production starts in the village and also shall increase the local\\'s attention in coffee market. This shall increase employment and can become a new standard profession in the village.

The alarm inside the forest plays with sounds that can frighten the elephant while the alarm in the village with led lights also alerts the villagers to be safe or use protective measures.
